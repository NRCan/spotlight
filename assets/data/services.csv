UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) - formerly SSC RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd (SSC) was formally registered as a company in 2007. It was initially established by the seven UK Research Councils in a drive for greater efficiency and harmonisation of processes. The project to set up the SSC completed in April 2011. During the transitional phase Research Councils grant application functions were transferred from individual Councils to the SSC, who are now the central point for all grant applications the Research Councils receive. Due to this change, the individual Councils no longer own separate functionality for grants processing and therefore should not be reporting as individual companies, but via the SSC as a single RCUK service which spans the whole of the Research Councils. As UK SBS will formally be taking on further grant process activity for other organisations, the description ensures that the distinction is made that these are just the Research Councils’ grants.
