Variations from baseline 2011-12 costs have been driven by changing volumes, investment and efficiencies already in train. <br>2. Unit cost data has been constructed using paybill data, with a 23% uplift for overheads. HMRC's costing framework is in development, and changes are in train to improve the accuracy of estates and IT cost apportionment. <br>3. Assumptions have been made about the balance of cost for transactional and enforcement/ other activity where business units mix both. <br>4. Additional IT investment to facilitate digital may alter the cost balance, with additional depreciation charges increasing online cost.",
  "other-notes": "1. HMRC is introducing PAYE Online, a new service to help individuals to manage their tax affairs and to deal with more complex areas such as tax codes and employer benefits. <br>2. The number of PAYE transactions increased significantly following the introduction of Real Time Information (RTI) in April 2013. When reporting in real time, employers send PAYE information electronically each time they pay their employees as part of routine payroll processes, rather than sending a separate return at the end of the year. The returns include details of their employeesâ€™ pay, tax and deductions. Reporting PAYE information in real time will improve PAYE making it quicker, easier and more accurate.",
