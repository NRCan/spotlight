It also includes the making of payments and any queries about non-receipt.<br>The costs are for the financial year 2012/13 and represent the total cost for all aspects of maintaining an application after the point that payments commence, including those of terminating the claim.<br>The costs of these various interactions are aggregated and averaged to give a cost per claim maintained, and this is presented on a fully absorbed basis but excluding investment (change) costs.",
