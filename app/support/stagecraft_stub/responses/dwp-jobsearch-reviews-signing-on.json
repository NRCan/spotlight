The costs exclude any action arising during the review that relates to benefit, such as taking signatures or a change in circumstances; these are covered under 'JSA: claims maintained'.<br>The costs are for the financial year 2012/13. They are aggregated and averaged to give a cost per intervention and this is presented on a fully absorbed basis but excluding investment (change) costs.",
