Variations from baseline 2011-12 costs have been driven by changing volumes, investment and efficiencies already in train. <br>2. Unit cost data has been constructed using paybill data, with a 23% uplift for overheads. HMRC's costing framework is in development and 2011-12 data have been updated with a more accurate reflection of volumes and costs. Changes are in train to improve the accuracy of estates and IT cost apportionment. <br>3. Assumptions have been made about the balance of cost for transactional and enforcement/ other activity where business units mix both. <br>4. Additional IT investment to facilitate digital may alter the cost balance, with additional depreciation charges increasing online cost.",
